Description
Are there any applications or services running in the network that are vulnerable to dictionary brute-force attacks?

Response
Yes - customer will see this mission marked as "Failed"

INTRO/DESCRIPTION
A dictionary brute-force attack is a method attackers use to gain unauthorized access by systematically attempting many possible passwords often from a precompiled list of common or leaked credentials against a login interface or authentication service. This type of attack targets weak authentication mechanisms that fail to implement proper rate limiting, account lockout policies, or CAPTCHA challenges.

According to the OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet, insufficient protection against automated credential-guessing attacks can lead to unauthorized access, account compromise, and credential stuffing at scale. Testing for this vulnerability involves evaluating whether applications or network services properly restrict repeated failed login attempts and implement safeguards such as throttling, 2FA, or strong password requirements.

TESTING METHODOLOGY
#### Assets tested: https://redacted.com
Tools Used:
- Nuclei (login discovery templates)
- Custom asynchronous brute‑force PoC software
- Browser developer tools
#### Steps:
1) I began by scanning the in‑scope asset using Nuclei to identify any exposed login interfaces across the application. 
I used standard authentication discovery templates to locate pages that accept username and password input. 
(see screenshot 1: I used the one liner in the image but forgot to take a picture of the output and now it seems to not be appearing via this method anymore.)

2) I manually validated the discovered authentication endpoints using browser developer tools.
I inspected form actions, request methods, and parameter names to ensure the PoC script would target the correct fields.
I also examined any client‑side behaviors such as JavaScript‑based validation or UI rate‑limiting indicators.
(see screenshots 2–4)

3) I prepared and executed a controlled brute‑force test using my custom PoC tool.
The tool sends password attempts, logs response bodies, and detects rate‑limiting or lockout behaviors.
(see screenshot 5-6, bruteforce_login.py and logs.txt)

I monitored responses for signs of brute‑force protection, including:
- Account lockout messages
- Required delays between attempts
- CAPTCHAs or human‑verification steps
- Increasing server response latency
- HTTP 429 or 503 errors indicating throttling

I reviewed both responses and requests generated by the PoC script in /logs/* for any discrepancies while testing.

CONCLUSION
During testing, the login endpoint at https://redacted.com
did not demonstrate any protections commonly used to mitigate automated credential‑guessing attempts. Throughout controlled testing at approximately 5 requests per second, the application returned a consistent failure message for all incorrect credentials, and no variations in HTTP responses or timing behavior were observed.

The application did not appear to implement:
- rate limiting or throttling mechanisms
- account lockout after repeated invalid attempts
- CAPTCHA or human verification challenges
- increased latency under sustained authentication attempts
Although the failure message remained uniform—which helps prevent username enumeration—the lack of additional brute‑force defenses may allow an attacker to perform large volumes of credential attempts without observable restrictions.

These results were consistent across both the automated PoC script and manual verification methods.
